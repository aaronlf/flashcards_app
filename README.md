# Flashcards app for rote learning 

To use, have answers filled out in text files. For chapters (notes), these are done already. There are also text files for the questions that come up over the years which need to be filled in (if anyone wants to contribute let me know I'm still working on this myself)
Comment out calls to quiz on topics/questions you  are not interested in (found from line 51 onwards).

You can shuffle the flashcard decks by putting shuffle=True and they can be reversed by putting reverse=True. By default these are true, and the paramters have been explicitly called for easy editing.

### Make sure you have the text files in the same directory.
### Make sure you install 'textwrap'. Use: pip install textwrap3

Good luck!
