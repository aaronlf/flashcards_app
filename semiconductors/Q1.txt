Explain the term “exciton” and distinguish clearly between Frenkel and Mott-Wannier excitons in a semiconductor.
£££

###


$$$
You are told that the radiative recombination lifetime, τ_r , of an emitter centre in a semiconductor is 50 ns, independent of temperature. The non-radiative recombination lifetime, τ_nr , is given by the following empirical temperature-dependent relationship:

τ_nr = 160 − 155(T/T+6)^2 (in ns)

where T is the absolute temperature in K. What is the effective excited state emitter lifetime at 4.2 K, 77 K and 300 K?
